# Andy enters a tennis tournament for 2^k players and the tournament
# is in knockout format. The players are randomly seeded (eg player 1
# plays against player 2) and each player has a level of skill. At each
# round there are 2 players, player a and b. player a may have skill a and
# player b has skill b then probability(player a wins) = skill a / (skill b +
# skill a). Calculate the probability that Andy wins the tournament in a fraction
# in lowest terms, then output the string concatenation followed by the denominator.
# The input you get is a dict mapping player name to skill.
